a. On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

b. git rev-list --all --count
   10 commits were made.

c.  Wed Sep 25 18:13:30 2019
git log .gitignore

d. Branches are used in git repositories to make changes in different context of
the master branch. This way multiple people can work on their own branch and then
add the changes to master. It also helps in giving an organized history of
the changes made towards a specific implementation.

e. git status shows you which changes have been made to the repository
locally, but have not been added.

git log shows you the list of all changes made to the files in the repository.

f.git log Vehicle.h

g. git log --all --grep='file'

h.

  I. Inheritance: the ability of a class to get characteristics and properties
     from another class.
  II. Polymorphism: this means that the call of a function will have do something
      different depending on what type of object it is being called with.
  III. Encapsulation: process of combining data members and functions in a single
       class.

i. On the "Integration manager workflow" the integration manager is responsible
  of checking the changes, on the other hand on the "Dictator and Lieutenant
  Workflow", everyone works on their own master branch which is then merged
  by the dictator.

j.  The Dictator and Lieutenant is better for larger teams as they don't need
  to explain all of their changes to a single person like in the other model.
